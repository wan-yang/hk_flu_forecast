## Study description
Influenza forecasts could aid public health response, but such efforts are more challenging in the tropics and subtropics given the diverse influenza epidemics therein. This study combines multiple technical innovations to develop forecast approaches for influenza in the (sub)tropics.  In addition to short-term targets (1- to 4-week ahead predictions), we also tested mid-range (1-3 months) and long-range (4-6 months) forecasts, which could be valuable for long-term planning. Testing using long-term data in subtropical Hong Kong showed the best-performing approach had forecast accuracies comparable to that reported for temperate regions, showcasing the promise of accurate influenza forecasts in the (sub)tropics.
